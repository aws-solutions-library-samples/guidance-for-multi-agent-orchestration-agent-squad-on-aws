# Guidance for Multi-Agent Orchestration with Agent-Squad on AWS


A demonstration of how AI agents and human support can work together in an e-commerce customer service environment. This project showcases intelligent query routing, multi-agent collaboration, and seamless human integration for complex support scenarios.

## üéØ Key Features

- Multi-agent AI orchestration with specialized models
- Real-time and asynchronous communication modes
- Seamless integration with human support workflow
- Tool-augmented AI interactions
- Production-ready AWS architecture
- Mock data for realistic scenarios

## Architecture Design
![agentsqaud](./img/agentsqaud.png)

1. The user accesses the web application through Amazon CloudFront, which delivers content from the Amazon S3 Website bucket, while Amazon Cognito handles authentication and provides temporary credentials via Identity Pool.

2. The authenticated user sends messages through the web UI, which communicates with AWS AppSync GraphQL API to process queries, mutations, and subscriptions for real-time communication.

3. AWS AppSync routes customer messages to the Amazon SQS Customer Messages Queue, which triggers the AWS Lambda Customer Message Handler function to process incoming customer inquiries.

4. AWS Lambda Customer Messages initializes the Agent Squad orchestrator, which uses Amazon Bedrock Classifier to analyze the message content and determine which specialized AI agent should handle the request.

5. Based on the classification, the message is routed to one of three agents: the Order Management Agent (using Claude 3 Sonnet), the Product Information Agent (using Claude 3 Haiku), or the Human Agent for complex cases requiring human intervention.

6. The Order Management Agent handles order-related inquiries using tools for order lookup, shipment tracking, and return processing, while the Product Information Agent retrieves product details from the Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Base connected to OpenSearch Serverless.

7. When complex inquiries are routed to the Human Agent, it performs two simultaneous actions: first, it immediately responds to the customer with a notification message confirming that their request has been received and will be handled by a human support representative; second, it sends the customer's original message to the Amazon SQS Support Messages Queue where human support staff can retrieve and process the request asynchronously.

8. Agent responses are sent to the Amazon SQS Outgoing Messages Queue, which triggers the AWS Lambda Send Response Handler to process and format the responses.

9. The Send Response Lambda sends the formatted responses back to AWS AppSync, which delivers them to the web UI through GraphQL subscriptions for real-time updates to the customer interface.

10. Throughout this process, Amazon DynamoDB stores conversation history and session data, while AWS IAM roles and policies ensure secure access to all services and resources.


## üíª Interface & Communication Modes

The system provides two distinct interaction modes to accommodate different support scenarios and user preferences:

### Real-Time Chat Interface
![Chat Mode](./img/chat_mode.png)

The chat interface provides immediate, conversational support:
- Instant messaging-style communication
- Live message streaming
- Real-time agent responses
- Automatic message routing
- Separate chat windows for customer and support perspectives

### Email-Style Communication
![Email Mode](./img/email_mode.png)

The email interface supports structured, asynchronous communication:
- Email composition interfaces for both customer and support
- Pre-defined templates for common scenarios
- Response viewing areas for both parties
- Asynchronous message handling
- Template support for standardized responses

### Key Features Across Both Modes

Both interfaces demonstrate:
1. **AI Capabilities**: Natural language understanding, context retention, appropriate tool usage
2. **Human Integration**: Seamless handoffs, verification workflows, complex case handling
3. **Tool Usage**: Order lookup, shipment tracking, return processing
4. **System Intelligence**: Query classification, routing decisions, escalation handling
